# Web Service

What is a web service? 

1. Web = Internet.
2. Service = API. 
3. Web Service = API that uses the Internet.

Web Service is just an API that uses the web or the internet. 
Not all APIs use the web. 

So, all web service is an API. 
But not all APIs are web service. 

Web Service use:
* XML or JSON to format data over the internet. 
* REST, SOAP, or XML/RPC to transfer the data (For sending over to the network).
